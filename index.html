            <h1>Christmas Boats</h1>
            <h3>Greece</h3>
            <p>Christmas trees are popular in Greece, but you’ll also find boats wrapped
            in strings of lights, whether in the water or in the main square.
            There are two explanations for the boat-decorating phenomenon:
            The first is that the country’s ancient maritime tradition means boats have
            always been an integral part of the culture, so they were decorated long before
            a modernized version of Christmas (including trees) came along. The second is that
            St. Nicholas is considered the patron saint of sailors, which is probably why boats
            are decorated on December 6th.</p>
