            <h1>Christmas Boats</h1>
            <h3>Greece</h3>
            <p>Christmas trees are popular in Greece, but you’ll also find boats wrapped
            in strings of lights, whether in the water or in the main square.
            There are two explanations for the boat-decorating phenomenon: 
            The first is that the country’s ancient maritime tradition means boats have
            always been an integral part of the culture, so they were decorated long before
            a modernized version of Christmas (including trees) came along. The second is that
            St. Nicholas is considered the patron saint of sailors, which is probably why boats
            are decorated on December 6th.</p>

            <h1>Venice Carnival</h1>
            <h3>Venice, Italy</h3>
            <p>Venice Carnival, Italy Carnival traditions vary widely around the world, 
            from Mardi Gras in New Orleans to the Samba parades in Rio de Janeiro. 
            In Venice, Carnival is all about the masked costume balls. The most in-demand 
            ones like the famous Il Ballo del Doge, the official dinner at Ca 'Vendramin 
            Calergi and the popular Casanova Grand Ball, tend to be prohibitively expensive
            and sell out quickly, but there are plenty of free events in addition to the balls.
            As for the backstory, Venice Carnival is tied to a 12th-century Catholic custom that
            likely evolved from winter solstice practices and marked a period of full-out debauchery
            before the no-fun season of Lent began. However, it can be argued that plenty of debauchery
            can still be found today during the two weeks in February leading up to Lent.</p>

            <h1>Hide the Brooms</h1>
            <h3>Norway</h3>
            <p>Some Norwegians believe witches and evil spirits roam the night sky on Christmas Eve.
            And what is a witch’s preferred mode of transportation? A broomstick. So out of an abundance
            of caution, people in Norway hide all of the brooms in their houses to prevent any witches
            from getting their hands on them. Sometimes people will take it a step further by firing a
            warning gunshot into the air to scare them off.</p>
